[+] ----------------------------------------------------------------

==>> The presence of the Network Security Configuration file...

[!] QuickNote:
    - It is recommended to configure the Network Security Configuration file (such as network_security_config.xml) as it does not exist. Please note that, Network Security Config file can be used to protect against cleartext traffic, set up trusted certificate authorities, implement certificate pinning, etc. in terms of network security settings.

[*] Reference:
    - OWASP MASVS: MSTG-NETWORK-1 | CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
    - https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/masvs/security-requirements/0x10-v5-network_communication_requirements

../test/MASTG-TEST0014_SAST/resources/AndroidManifest.xml
grep: ../test/MASTG-TEST0014_SAST/resources/AndroidManifest.xml: No such file or directory

[!] QuickNote:
    - It is recommended that the appropriate Permission should be set via android:permission attribute with a proper android:protectionLevel in the AndroidManifest file, if observed. Please note that, The unprotected components can be invoked by other malicious applications and potentially access sensitive data or perform any of the privileged tasks possibly.

[*] Reference:
    - OWASP MASVS: MSTG-PLATFORM-1 | CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
    - https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/masvs/security-requirements/0x11-v6-interaction_with_the_environment

==>> The Remote WebView Debugging setting...


==>> The instances of Java Objects exposure through WebViews...


==>> The Object Persistence/Serialization instances...


==>> The WebViews Cleanup implementation...

[!] QuickNote:
    - It is recommended to clear the WebView resources when the application accesses any sensitive data within that, which may include any files stored locally, the RAM cache, and any loaded JavaScript. Please note that, this present a potential security risk if any sensitive data is being exposed.

[*] Reference:
    - OWASP MASVS: MSTG-PLATFORM-10 | CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
    - https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/masvs/security-requirements/0x11-v6-interaction_with_the_environment

==>> The Application Update mechanism...

[!] QuickNote:
    - It is recommended that applications should be forced to be updated. If a security update comes in, then AppUpdateType.IMMEDIATE flag should be used in order to make sure that the user cannot go forward with using the app without updating it. Please note that, newer versions of an application will not fix security issues that are living in the backends to which the app communicates.

[*] Reference:
    - OWASP MASVS V1: MSTG-ARCH-9 | CWE-1277: Firmware Not Updateable
    - https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/masvs/security-requirements/0x06-v1-architecture_design_and_threat_modelling_requireme
