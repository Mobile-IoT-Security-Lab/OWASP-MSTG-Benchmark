    <string name="overview">Explanation:\n
&#8226; This script prompts the user to input their name and email.\n
&#8226; It then sends this data directly to a third-party API endpoint without any anonymization.\n&#8226;If an attacker intercepts this communication, they can easily obtain the user\'s name and email, which are considered PII.\n
To improve the security of this application, you would need to implement proper anonymization techniques such as hashing or encryption of the PII before sending it to the third-party service. Additionally, you should review the third-party service\'s documentation to ensure compliance with best practices and data protection regulations
