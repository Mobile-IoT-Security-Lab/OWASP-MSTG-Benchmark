Exploitation Scenario:

An attacker exploits the vulnerability in session token generation to perform a session hijacking attack:

The attacker intercepts the session token of a legitimate user while it's transmitted over the network or stored insecurely.
The attacker uses their knowledge of the predictable session token generation algorithm (based on java.util.Random) to generate valid session tokens.
The attacker crafts HTTP requests with the generated session tokens and sends them to the server, effectively impersonating the legitimate user.
The server, unable to distinguish between legitimate and forged session tokens, accepts the requests and performs actions on behalf of the attacker, such as posting unauthorized content or accessing sensitive user data.
Mitigation:

To mitigate this vulnerability, the app should use a cryptographically secure random number generator like SecureRandom for session token generation. Additionally, implementing other security measures such as HTTPS for secure communication, secure storage of sensitive data, and session management best practices can further enhance the app's security posture.

By addressing the vulnerability and implementing appropriate security measures, the app can better protect user sessions from exploitation by malicious actors.
